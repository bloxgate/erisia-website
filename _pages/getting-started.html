<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Erisia uses
  the <a href="http://mcupdater.com/">MCUpdater</a> framework
  for distributing pack updates.  Using this is moderately
  complex, compared to e.g. ATLauncher, but it also allows for
  quick updates.
<p>To get started:
  <ol>
    <li>First of all, make sure you join irc.rizon.net channel
      #erisia. This channel is linked to the servers, and is an
      excellent place to get help or generally hang out. If you
      don't have a preferred IRC client, click the 'IRC' link on
      the menubar.
    <li>Make sure you have 64-bit Java 7 or Java 8 installed, preferably the latter.
    <li>Download and run <a href="MCU-Bootstrap.jar">MCU-Bootstrap</a>.
    <li>Select Erisia from the instance list.
    <li>Make sure shadercore and optifine are disabled in the
      mods list, unless you'd like to use them. Generally, check which optional mods you want.
    <li>Click update
    <li>After the update is done: In the settings screen,
      change max memory size to 4G (minimum, 8G is better) and
      permgen to 384M (minimum; I use 512M). Click save. Do <em>not</em> change the minimum memory setting, only the maximum.
    <li>Click launch.
  </ol>
<p>If you're lucky, this will let you into Erisia. If not,
  please make sure you're actually using 64-bit Java 7; if you
  aren't using that, you're going to need to delete the
  installation directory before trying again.
<p>Depending on your OS, here's where to find it:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux: ~/.MCUpdater</li>
    <li>OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/MCUpdater</li>
    <li>Windows: %APPDATA%/.MCUpdater</li>
  </ul>
